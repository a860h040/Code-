**TITLE:** 340B Strategy Under Pressure — Staying Compliant, Protecting Savings, and Using Analytics to Show Value

**INTRO:**
The 340B Program can save hospitals a lot of money. But audits and scrutiny are increasing. Many health systems struggle to balance compliance, contracts, and daily workflow.

**BODY:**
**Where savings can get lost:**

* Duplicate discounts (getting the same discount twice by mistake)
* Contract pharmacy complexity (many moving parts and rules)
* Mixed-use inventory (340B and non-340B drugs getting mixed together)
* Documentation gaps (missing or unclear records)

**What to track and benchmark:**

* Eligible claims capture rate (how many eligible claims you actually capture)
* Audit findings (problems found during audits)
* Split-billing exception rate (how often the billing system has errors/exceptions)
* Savings vs leakage (how much you save vs how much you lose from mistakes)

**Governance model (how to manage it well):**

* Regular compliance checks
* Standard reports on a set schedule (weekly/monthly)

**VIZIENT IMPACT:**
Vizient advisory and analytics can help members:

* Standardize 340B reporting across sites
* Find “leakage” (where savings are being lost)
* Compare performance to similar organizations (peer benchmarking)

**Suggested deliverables:**

* A member-ready 340B KPI report (easy to share with leadership)
* An “audit readiness” checklist (what to have prepared before an audit)

**CONCLUSION:**
**Deliverable:** 340B dashboard template + audit readiness checklist.
**Engagement idea:** a short “spot the leakage” mini-case activity.

**TITLE:** Pharmacy Contract Compliance & Standard Use — How Networks Improve Market Share and Save Money

**INTRO:**
A good pharmacy contract does not help if people do not use it correctly. This topic focuses on a repeatable process to improve contract compliance and reduce variation across sites.

**BODY:**
**Why compliance drops:**

* NDC variation (same drug, different NDCs that are not on contract)
* Substitutions (switching products that are not contracted)
* Prescriber preference (providers choose different brands/products)
* Formulary drift (the formulary changes over time without control)
* Contract gaps (needed items are not covered by the GPO contract)

**What to measure:**

* Contract market share (how much you buy on contract vs total)
* Off-contract spend (money spent outside the contract)
* Top “leakage” items (items causing the most off-contract spend)
* Conversion rate after interventions (how many switch back after changes)

**How to improve compliance (change tactics):**

* Align order sets and formulary (make the right product the default)
* Add purchasing controls (limit non-contract options when appropriate)
* Build exception workflows (clear rules for when off-contract is allowed)
* Use feedback loops (share results with sites and prescribers regularly)

**VIZIENT IMPACT:**
Vizient Pharmacy Networks and analytics can help members:

* Benchmark contract market share and compliance across peers
* Support standardization across multiple hospitals or sites

**Suggested deliverables:**

* Contract compliance playbook (step-by-step process)
* Starter KPI definitions for cross-member comparison (same metrics, same rules)

**CONCLUSION:**
**Deliverable:** Compliance scorecard + top 10 leakage action plan.
**Engagement idea:** Quick poll: “What is the biggest barrier to compliance?”

**TITLE:** Specialty Pharmacy Growth & Financial Impact — Using Data to Improve Access, Adherence, and Total Cost of Care

**INTRO:**
Specialty pharmacy is growing quickly and drives a large part of drug spending. The challenge is how to grow programs while proving outcomes and keeping patient access realistic.

**BODY:**
**Key decisions and challenges:**

* Build vs partner (run your own specialty pharmacy or work with an outside partner)
* Site-of-care shifts (moving therapy from hospital/infusion center to home or outpatient settings)
* Payer requirements and prior authorization workload (more rules, more paperwork, more delays)

**What to measure (core KPIs):**

* Referral capture rate (how many referrals you keep in your program)
* Time-to-therapy (how long it takes to start treatment)
* Abandonment rate (how often patients do not start after approval/prescription)
* Adherence (PDC = proportion of days covered)
* Total cost signals (changes in hospitalizations, ED visits, overall spend trends)

**Operational analytics (how to find problems):**

* Where the bottlenecks are in the process
* Staffing productivity (work volume per staff time)
* Turnaround time for key steps (intake → benefits → PA → fill → delivery)
* Top denial reasons (why payers say “no”)

**VIZIENT IMPACT:**
Vizient pharmacy advisory and analytics can help members:

* Build standardized specialty pharmacy metrics
* Compare performance across similar organizations (peer benchmarking)

**Suggested deliverables:**

* Specialty pharmacy KPI dashboard template
* “Bottleneck” workflow map (shows where referrals get delayed)

**CONCLUSION:**
**Deliverable:** Specialty KPI pack + workflow improvement checklist.
**Engagement idea:** Short scenario: “Where does the referral get stuck?”
