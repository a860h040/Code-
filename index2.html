TITLE: Contract Price Integrity: Using Vizient Catalog & Price Verification to Prevent Overpayment

INTRO:
Hospitals can lose money when the price on an invoice is different from the contracted price. This topic explains how teams can use contract and pricing tools to find “pricing leakage” early and fix it with less manual work.

BODY
Common reasons pricing is incorrect

The wrong contract tier is applied.

The unit of measure (UOM) is wrong (for example, “each” vs “box”).

The wholesaler’s pricing file is not updated.

A product is substituted or packaged differently than expected.

A simple, clean workflow

1. Find the mismatch (invoice price does not match contract price).

2. Confirm the correct contract terms (tier, UOM, contract coverage).

3. Escalate to the right contact (wholesaler, vendor, internal buyer).

4. Request and track credits (recover the overpaid amount).

5. Fix the root cause so it does not happen again.

What to measure

Mismatch rate (how often prices do not match)

Dollars recovered ($ recovered)

Time to fix each issue (time-to-resolution)

Top causes (UOM errors, tier errors, missing contract coverage)

VIZIENT IMPACT

Vizient Catalog

Vizient Catalog helps as a “source of truth” for product details, pricing, and contract information. This helps members know what they should be paying.

Pharmacy Price Verification

Pharmacy Price Verification supports centralized monitoring. It helps members find incorrect charges for Vizient-contracted products and recover credits.

Benchmarking idea (simple KPIs across members)

% of spend reviewed

$ recovered per $X of spend

Top 5 root causes of mismatches

CONCLUSION

Deliverable: Pricing Leakage Scorecard + root-cause checklist
Engagement: Quick poll: “What is your most common mismatch cause?” + two short mini-cases

TITLE: Proving Pharmacy Value with Data: Savings Actualyzer (Pharmacy) & Pharmacy Value Tracker

INTRO:
Finding savings is important, but proving it and explaining it clearly is just as important. This topic shows how pharmacy analytics can turn purchasing data into real savings results that leaders can understand and use.

BODY
What “value” means in pharmacy

Contract compliance (buying at the correct contract price)

Cost avoidance (preventing extra costs before they happen)

Recovered dollars (getting money back from incorrect charges)

Utilization shifts (moving use to better-value options)

Shortage mitigation (reducing cost or risk during shortages)

How analytics finds opportunities

Price-to-price comparisons (your price vs another price)

Converting non-contract items to contract items

Tracking variance trends (prices changing over time)

Finding outliers (items with unusually high cost or use)

Practical metrics to track

Opportunity size (how big the savings could be)

Adoption rate (how often the change is actually used)

Realized savings (savings that truly happened)

Sustainability (whether savings continues over time)

VIZIENT IMPACT
Vizient Savings Actualyzer – Pharmacy

Vizient Savings Actualyzer – Pharmacy helps members find savings opportunities by combining data with market insight. It also presents the information in a format that is easy to share with leadership.

Pharmacy Value Tracker (PVT)

Pharmacy Value Tracker tracks the added value from portfolio or program improvements. It also highlights other opportunities for additional savings.

Benchmarking idea (to compare members fairly)

Use standard definitions for:

Identified savings (possible savings found in data)

Realized savings (savings actually achieved after implementation)
This helps members compare performance in a consistent way.

CONCLUSION

Deliverable: Savings Opportunity Playbook (identify → prioritize → implement → track)
Engagement: Short Kahoot: “Which opportunity is highest confidence?” vs “Which is highest effort?”

TITLE: Forecasting Pharmacy Spend in a Volatile Market: Drug Budget Forecast & Market Outlook Signals

INTRO:
Planning a pharmacy budget is harder now because drug prices can change quickly. New drug launches, inflation, shortages, and changes in how drugs are used can all impact spending. This topic explains a clear forecasting method that pharmacy leaders can trust.

BODY
Main reasons budgets miss the target

New product launches (new drugs added to the market)

Biosimilars (switching to lower-cost alternatives)

Shortage substitutions (using different drugs because the usual drug is unavailable)

Contract changes (new pricing or contract terms)

Mix shift (using more of certain drugs than expected)

Site-of-care shifts (moving treatment to a different setting, like inpatient vs outpatient)

A simple forecasting workflow

1. Start with baseline spend (what you usually spend).

2. Adjust using market signals (expected changes from the market).

3. Build scenarios: best case / base case / worst case.

4. Review monthly results and explain the variance (difference between forecast and actual spend).

KPIs to track

Forecast accuracy (how close the forecast is to real spend)

Top variance drivers (the main reasons the forecast was off)

“Early warning” thresholds (signals that spending may change soon)

VIZIENT IMPACT
Pharmacy Market Outlook

Pharmacy Market Outlook shares market factors that may affect purchasing patterns over the next 6 to 18 months.

Drug Budget Forecast (DBF)

Drug Budget Forecast helps create line-item spend projections based on a member’s spending mix. It supports budgeting and longer-term planning.

Benchmarking idea (compare similar members)

Compare forecast accuracy and top variance drivers across similar groups, such as members with the same size or similar service lines.

CONCLUSION

Deliverable: Forecast Template + Variance Dashboard
Engagement: Live scenario exercise: “What happens to the budget if a drug goes on shortage or a biosimilar launches?”
